/**
 * Semester 1 subject catalog + Firebase links helper.
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------
 * This is the classroom-side twin of SUBJECTS_BY_SEMESTER in
 * ../../executive.html and ../../index.html — same codes/names, but
 * scoped to just this semester since every page in this folder only
 * ever needs its own semester's subjects.
 *
 * Download buttons on index.html / notes.html / ebooks.html /
 * pyqs.html don't hold a hardcoded URL anymore — they resolve
 * "<subjectCode>-<Notes|PYQs|eBooks>" against Firebase's /links
 * table at render time (the same table executive.html's "Product
 * links" panel writes to). A subject with no matching row just shows
 * "Not uploaded yet" instead of a dead link.
